  Blink without Delay (BWOD)

  Turns on and off a light emitting diode (LED) connected to a digital pin,
  without using the delay() function. This means that other code can run at the
  same time without being interrupted by the LED code.

  The circuit:
  - Use the onboard LED.
  - Note: Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA
    and ZERO it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN
    is set to the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
    If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your
    Arduino model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

// constants won't change. Used here to set a pin number:
const int ledPin =  LED_BUILTIN;// the number of the LED pin

// Variables will change:
int ledState = LOW;             // ledState used to set the LED

// Generally, you should use "unsigned long" for variables that hold time
// The value will quickly become too large for an int to store
unsigned long previousMillis = 0;        // will store last time LED was updated

// constants won't change:
const unsigned long interval = 250 ;// interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

  // return false if we're still "delaying", true if time ms has passed.
  // this should look a lot like "blink without delay"

void loop()

	  // check to see if it's time to blink the LED; that is, if the difference
	  // between the current time and last time you blinked the LED is bigger than
	  // the interval at which you want to blink the LED.
	if (delayingIsDone(previousMillis, interval)) {
	    // if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa:
		ledState = ledState==LOW?HIGH:LOW ;

	    // set the LED with the ledState of the variable:
